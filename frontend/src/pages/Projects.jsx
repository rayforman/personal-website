In an effort to better understand the revolutionary \"Transformer\" architecture, introduced by Google Brain in 2017 (Vaswani et al.), I decided to build one myself, from scratch. While nowhere near as robust and human-sounding as the enterprise LLMs of today, this project taught me that GPTs at their core are not that complicated. In fact, they're quite simple-- that's what makes them brilliant. Having a line-by-line understanding of how they're built in practice gave me a strong foundation to innovate on, fine-tune, and explore new use cases of the readily available LLMs through APIs. This project commands understanding of key transformer concepts, namely self-attention, multi-head attention, and positional encodings.",
